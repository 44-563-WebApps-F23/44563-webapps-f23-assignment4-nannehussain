    <h1>Shaik Nanne Hussain acts in a play</h1>

    <h3>An Enemy of the People , Henrik Ibsen</h3>
    <h4>ACT-IV Scene.-</h4>

    <p>Horster.:
        I thought you might all sit here; you can slip out easily from here,
        if things get too lively.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Stockmann (sitting down).:
        It was extremely kind of you to offer my husband
        the room.</p>
    <p>Peter Stockmann.: 
        For various reasons, which you will easily understand,
        I must beg to be excused. But fortunately we have amongst us a man who
        I think will be acceptable to you all. I refer to the President of the
        Householders' Association, Mr. Aslaksen.</p>
    <p>Aslaksen.: 
        And now, as I am in this position, I should like to say a few
        brief words. I am a quiet and peaceable man, who believes in discreet
        moderation, and—and—in moderate discretion. All my friends can bear
        witness to that.</p>
    <p>Hovstad.: 
        I, too, feel called upon to explain my position. Dr.
        Stockmann's agitation appeared to be gaining a certain amount of
        sympathy at first, so I supported it as impartially as I could. But
        presently we had reason to suspect that we had allowed ourselves to be
        misled by misrepresentation of the state of affairs</p>
    <p>Dr. Stockmann (continuing).: 
        I have thought and pondered a great deal,
        these last few days—pondered over such a variety of things that in the
        end my head seemed too full to hold them</p>   
    <p>Angry Voices.: 
        Turn out that drunken man! Turn him out. (He is turned
        out again.)</p>
